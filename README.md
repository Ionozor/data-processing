##  Overview

The Ionozor project provides tools for analyzing Very Low Frequency (VLF) data as well as an accessible platform for sharing the corresponding results. Leveraging the Python and Octave/MATLAB languages, this project helps deliver deep scientific data-based insight into ionospheric and space-based phenomena, including the analysis of radio signals from various sources like meteor and solar activity effects on the ionosphere. Equipped with algorithms, the project provides visualization and carefully considered processing of general ionospheric and radio-signal-based data, paving the way for detailed analysis to a level where plasma and electromagnetic interactions at different altitudes are available. This contributes to a deeper understanding of interactions between Earth's atmosphere and outer-space phenomena and could support wider scientific research in astronomical events, meteorology, and atmospheric physics, essential for scientists and researchers in relevant domains.

##  Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ** Architecture**     | The project utilizes a highly language-diverse architecture, mainly consisting of Python and Octave; the former for digital signal processing and data handling and the latter for numerical computations involved in VLF data analysis.    |
| ** Documentation**   | Although detailed logging is provided in the code, understanding individual functions and their data-flow aren't outwardly unfolded. Explicit in-line code commenting is missing, decreasing rapid cognizance of distinct code sections.    |
| ** Dependencies**    | The codebase is dependent on external libraries. Python notebooks appear to use libraries such as os and urllib for data handling. Octave scripts necessitate specialty packages for numerical and signal processing.    |
| ** Modularity**      | The system modules are well-separated according to their functionality. E.g., Octave-based data extraction & processing in unique files, whereas plotting parameters are managed and grouped by separate Python codes. Data is transferred between these modules via intermediate storage.
| ** Testing**          | The repository, however, does not involve explicit testing codes. Thus, user testing, probable hardcoded debugging, and trial-run methodologies can be assumed but these won't vouch for systematic, rigorous validation.    |
| ** Performance**      | Considering the limited availability of function benchmarks; structured high-performance cannot be conclusively confirmed. Efficient computational operations have still been considered e.g., keeping intermediate files minimal/flushing almost certain outcomes.    |
| ** Security**         | Proper security measures are not explicitly showcased. Using urllib library for cloud-based computations can arguably raise concerns due to nonencrypted or authenticated channels of information request/transmission. |
| ** Version Control** | Github is utilized for versioning, but no outlines probably contradicts regular or hierarchic updates. Most scripts are standalone; version control seems redundant here. Keeping more utility functions could have maximized script-upgrade tracking. |
| ** Integrations**    | Its integration being pulling data from AWS servers online. Saving processed stimuli in HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format), evidently meeting requirements of efficient data exchange & archival storage. |
| ** Scalability**     | Its manageable division across services ascertains better lateral scaling. The python requires linear scheme progression, though fits well with horizontally derived data considerations seen here networking or user-access scalability scopes remain questionable. |

| [speclab2octave.sh](https://github.com/Ionozor/data-processing/blob/main/Octave/bin/speclab2octave.sh)               | This is a Bash script for managing data, primarily performing data extraction and time conversion. The script requires three command line arguments representing input_file, output_file1, and output_file2. It performs file-processing tasks: extract the first two column-values from input CSV file-convert the time value (given in second column of hh:mm:ss format) to its decimal representation and save it in output_file1, extract and save second column data into output_file2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [pathlocation.m](https://github.com/Ionozor/data-processing/blob/main/Octave/bin/pathlocation.m)                     | The code is retrieving data sets of the previous day's Very Low Frequency (VLF) observations from the Ionozor's web server. The first set of code gets yesterday's date and constructs file paths. There are hard extensions for the assumed-life paths, with statistic names like VLFOSTROV, HFKVARY, and RATIOS. Data is fetched using'urlread' function, put often on local folders depending on statistical names (which is changed/directed thrice) and their pathways are set. It also creates directories in the local system for each set. Variables'stept' and'stepnu' are set to 0.5 and 10 respectively (could be used, omitted in the given texts). Lastly, SID1-a not defined command, function or script is run. The exact purpose of not accounting for this therefore cannot be ascribed properly. |

Subsequently, it executes different series of data processing Octave ".m" scripts based on the location and inserts zero values at required lines in input text files. After every Octave execution, it checks and cleans up empty stderr files too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [process_data-location.sh](https://github.com/Ionozor/data-processing/blob/main/Octave/bin/process_data-location.sh) | This script primarily manages data manipulation for use by Octave.m scripts, generated by Spectrum Lab from different locations (HVEZDARNA, OSTROV, & SOKOLOV). Initially, the script checks, creates necessary directories, and clears destination before processing: it transforms.txt spectral data from these sources into Octave-friendly input, runs a set of Octave.m scripts (using a'nice' priority), specific to each source to process the data, with another set for common data flow. Scripts executed depend on the "location" value, along with an error checking functionality. It also deletes empty.err (stderr) outputs and prepares maintenance functions for files with warnings and generated meteroic spectra.                                                                              |
