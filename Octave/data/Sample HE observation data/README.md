SID monitors provide us to detect some strong high-energy impacts caused to happen by deep space GRB sources, quasars, blazars, AGN and so on.

In May 2016, most likely on May 12, 2016, we managed to measured some increased high-energy activities of HII region LBN 1091 which was localized owing to the supplemental HF measurement. Actually, it provided the ability to determine the position angle and real distance of investigated object.

Some simple physical parameters were modeled and given.
* Having computed the initial energy of the outburst and taking into account the relativistic phenomena, we are able to compute the angular momentum of the system.
* Thus, the basic parameters like distance and angular size could have been reached.
* Owing to the knowledge about the energy, we are able to distinguish the kinetic energy of the system and having gone through the method similar to Particle in Cell, we can compute the temperature of investigated HII region.
* We were interested in the plasma solid where the detected outburst was cumulated, indeed. To describe such a system, the electron density was determined and the temperature-dependent model was drawn (Figure 1 - 'Blasar.jpeg').
* Similar plot, using the measured angular size, is given in Figure 2 'Blasar_size_angle_temperature.jpeg'.
* Within both models, the burst caused by increasing HE activity can be distinguished.
* Having gone through energy and plasma aspects, we could have determined the emission spectra of such object (Figure 3 - 'Blasar_spectra_20160512.jpeg').
* It can be seen that the biggest intensity accompanied wavelengths betwenn 20 and 21 nanometers. Properly analysis will be completed soon.

Our results stands up to comparsion with emipirical data, see e.g. http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=LBN++1091.
