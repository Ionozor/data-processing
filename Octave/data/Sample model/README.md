The model describing the electron density distribution in a fireball solid is given. Such a fireball was detected on March 06, 2016 and was pretty well-known in the Czech Fireball Network.

If the electron density and plasma temperature change in the ionospheric plasma is computed, we can solve these variables as the partial differential equation system. See `https://github.com/Ionozor/data-processing/tree/master/Octave/data/Sample%20data`.

We are able to work out how the meteoric plasma temperature and electron density looks like. Using the script for ionogram analysis, we can approximate the electron density as a function totally dependent on the temperature.

When the differential equation using parameter dn/dT is solved, we acquire the 3D contour plot describing the electron density's distribution. By the time the fireball reaches the ionosphere, an ionized cover is set up to surround the fireball. Looking at the model, we can see that next to the primary fireball discharge, even a secondary plasma discharge was fired up in the ionized cover.

We can deduce that some d-elements such as scandium, titanium, chromium and manganese and their positive ions were located near the fireball's core.  First of all, we can expect some ionization - recombination reaction with the OH partical or other clusters in the ionosphere; see enclosed spectral data.

Corresponing with the relatively hight temperatures we could expect the presence of some s- and p- metallic elements, for example Li and Mg or their positive ions as well.

The spectral models are given, too. We can even deduce that the presence of those metals was verified.

We can also show the modeled curves describing the fireball's electron density and plasma temperature.
