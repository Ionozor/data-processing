Some sample data from VLF station are given. They were chosen from March 6, 2016 when a strongly shining fireball was detected by The Czech Fireball Network. The common data flow was used to run GNU Octave scripts - see the appropriate repository. 
For these models, we use the radio signal measured on our SID monitors. Special attention is paid to the DHO38 transmitter.
Let’s go through the data graph to graph.
- Acceleration
If an impact reaches the ionosphere, some electrons in the low temperature plasma are accelerated. This plot describes the numeric solution of this acceleration. We can see that this phenomenon can be described as an oscilátory motion with variable amplitude which corresponds with the radio signal intensity level, indeed. The next claim we are able to do is that the phenomena are completely quasistatic.
- Critical frequence change
In this graph, the momental electron plasma frequency is shown. This is the result of the basic equation of the whole model, a polynomial differential equation. Using this quantity, the electron density can be computed.
- Debye radius
By the time the electron density and the plasma temperature is known, we are able to approximate the Debye radius. We can see that its value limitally approaches to constant ~ 31,4 microns.
- Discharges
The contour 3D plot of radio bursts in the ionosphere is shown. We work with the radio signal intensity and the electron’s density partial derivation. We can distinguish some interesting phenomena connected with meteoric impacts or solar eruptions.
- Effective temperature
Within the electron density’s and plasma temperature’s change measured in the ionosphere, we can compute the effective temperature and the electron density of the appropriate impact. In this model, we use the Stephan’s Law, the Wien’s Law and the equations known for describing of partical’s de-excitation. If these parameters are known, we are able to approach the fireball‘s emission spektra.
- Effective temperature of meteor (the Sun) and electron density of meteor (the Sun)
A simple models that help us to get known when the impact reach the ionospheric plasma and to approach the continuance of these quantities. Unfortunately, this measurement includes a big mistake so some new models were prepared.
- Electron density
If we know the value of electron plasma frequency, we can easily count the electron density od the ionospheric plasma. This quantity is shown.
- Emission density and spectra
Because of the known plasma temperature of the investigating fireball, we are able to compute its electron density and approach atomic numbers of de-excited chemical elements. Some d-elements of the fourth periode can be expected. 
- Energy 
The Arrhenius equation can be approached to compute on which energy level are the molecules in the ionospheric plasma currently ionized. In the plot - Energy spectrum, the energy is compared with the radio burst energy and also with computed ionization levels of chosen molecules. On the plot -Frequence gamma, this energy was used to approach the frequency of appropriate photon quantum.
- Entropy 
The termodynamci entropy is shown. We can see, that its value is small.
- Gradients
A 3D plot where the electron density’s change is compared with the height of the currently localized ionospheric plasma. On the plots -Height and -Height 2, the height is drawn, too but more detailed. The graph called -Ionogram shows the height as a function of the total electron density’s derivation. We can easily recognize some impacts that are distinguished like strong peaks.
- Heat
If the temperatur eis known, the heat energy can also be approached. We can see that its value is relatively small and converges to a constant.
- Intensity of meteors‘ (the Sun’s) impact
The impact intensity is chosen in arbitrary units and can be described as the emission wavelenght’s function. This plot shows the intensity and the wavelenght variable in the current time. We would say the Sun’s intensity wasn’t measurable in that day so the empty plot wasn’t even uploaded.
- Ionization degree
The ionization degree in the ionospheric plasma is computed. We use the Saha equation’s approximation and also count with the small-angle and large-angle dispersion. After that, we are able to compare these values easily.
- Kinetic energy
If the temperature is known, we can use the approximation to compute the kinetic energy. In the plot -Potential energy, we have computed the potential energy, too. What we used was the plasma parameter shown in the appropriate graph. This parameter is very important for plasma physics because we know it describes the amount of particles localized in the Debye sphere.
- Meteoric cover spectra, electron density and temperature
By the time the fireball reaches the ionospheric plasma, a ionized cover is localized to surround the solid. Using our spectral model, we can work out how the physical and even chemical phenomena in the cover may have looked like. In the plot - Meteoric cover spectra, the intensity and wavelenght are shown together again.
- Plasma spectrum
The energy level plasma which reaches the ionospheric plasma as the corpuscular or electromagnetic quantum is compared with the ionization level of the appropriate amount within chosen particles.
- Scope
The fluctuation scope is solved as a primitive function of their velocity. We can see that the maximal peaks of this quantity are always smaller then the Debye radius, which is suitable for every ideal plasma.
- SID model
The radio signal intensity level is drawn and compared with our model. The input files, the tima and the intensity level, are saved as t.txt and L.txt, so they can be used for other computation. We can easily recognise strong SIDs in this plot.
- Specific calorific capacity
The specific calorific capacity of the ionospheric plasma is approached using the current temperature.
- Temperature
Eventually, we can have a look at the temperature. We use the electron density to compute this quantity and we can see that the middle value of the temperature is approximately ~193.02 K.
- Velocity
The middle quadratic velocity is given as the function of the kinetic energy and temperature. We can easily recognise the fluctuation peak within this plot.
- Wavelengths decay
The wavelengths‘ decay some chosen molecules‘ ionization is computed in appropriate units. Those values are used to draw the energy and plasma spectra.
- Wavelengths of meteor (the Sun)
This figures show the wavelenght on which the most energy is currently emitted. It is used to compute the emission spectra as well.
- X-ray flux
If an impact reaches the ionosphere, we are able to compute its X-ray flux. Special attention is paid to the flux trapped in the Debye sphere and also to the ionization potential of this flux.
- ASCII text files
The discussed quantities are also saved in the enclosed ascii text files.
