Some sample data acquired by the HF measurement are given. They were chosen from December 21, 2015 when strong radio outbursts coming from a very young star were detected. For more informations, see for example https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1551a/.
The data were analysed by the common scripts within GNU Octave which is given in the appropriate repository.
Let's go through the results graph to graph.
- Radiotelescope \\
In this plot, the radio signal intesity level measured on the frequency 20.1 MHz is shown. If this exact frequency is used, the Sun and Jupiter can be monitored in the radio spectrum very easily. However, using our models and a transformation system, we can detect some stong impacts from the deep space, too.
We can see the dependence could be described as an oscillation function, while the relative amplitude of strong peaks sharply differs from the basic state.
- X-ray energy \\
If the radio signal intensity level is known, we can computed the value of radiated energy. Within our approximation, the basic formulas describing the power and the energy of a homogenous transmitter was used. The approximation is invariant for the condition t << 1, which is filled.
Such a model provides the current X-ray energy and the amount of radiated photons can be computed, too.
To complete the sample data, a graph describing the emitted energy during the Io-B Jupiter Storm detected on December 20, 2015 was enclosed.
- Ray-burst distance \\
By the time the current X-ray energy is known, the ray burst's distance can be modeled. The appropriate numerical solution is given by the differential equations' system describing the linear momentum and the angular momentum.
It can be deduced, that the hypothetic distance significantly differs in the time. However, the strong emission was detected clearly and the single peaks approach each other well.
