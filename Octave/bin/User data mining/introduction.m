disp(['1. VLF spectrum:'])
disp(['This is the spectrum of radio waves in the scale of 15~80 kHz. Such frequencies are reflected by the D ionospheric layer, so they behaviour represented by the function of intensity over frequency can provide a lot of informations about the region.'])
disp(['2. Ionogram:'])
disp(['This is a common diagram used to describe the ionosphere and its behaviour within the time-resolved ration of current electron density and height.'])
disp(['3. 3D ionospheric model:'])
disp(['The 3D graphic model of the D ionospheric layer is made using the ionogram and by approaching the drift velocity. It describes the focusation and defocusation of the layer.'])
disp(['4. High-energy impact spectra:'])
disp(['Within the ionospheric response described by the phase-height ionogram, some real physical parameters of high-energy impacts such as spectra can be given by approximation of their energy.'])
